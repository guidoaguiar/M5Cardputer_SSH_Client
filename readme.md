## How to use
A: Download the .ino file and flash it with your favorite tool

B: Use the M5Launcher and download the .bin file and put it in the MicroSD card

Every time it boots it will ask for SSID and its password, and if the connection is successful it will then ask for SSH host, username and password.

## Planned features
Save WiFi cred
scan WiFi

## FYI
Fell free to contribute.
